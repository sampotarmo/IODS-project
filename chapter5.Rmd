# Part 6. Analysis of longitudinal data

***

I'm sick and don't have energy for anything. Fortunately, I am familiar with random effect models since I used those in my master's thesis.

I have *really* enjoyed this course! The best thing I've learned is easily *the tools*, R, Git and Github. I'm quite I'll be using those a lot more from now on. I hope you do too!
